We live in a world full of data, but how can we best use it? It's hardly a secret that data is the most precious thing on the planet when used wisely.

The goal of **towards data** is to virtually unite data professionals, each with their own unique set of skills and expertise, to share their insights with one another.Â Presently, it serves as a blog platform where we delve into a broad variety of data-related concepts, such as how to productively produce, manage, and democratize data.

Teaching oneself in the clearest words possible and then passing that information on to those who are interested in our areas of expertise has shown to be a very effective strategy of improving our understanding even better.

I'm sure I can count on many of you agreeing with me when I say that, depending on the subject, it may take a lot of time to read several books, blogs, and other documents until we discover one that conveys the concept in a way that connects with us. It should come as no surprise that the most satisfying explanations that stick with us may consist of fragments of information from more than one source. To save you time and effort, **towards data** aims to be your first stop for information that is not only easier to understand but also covers all the ground you'll need to fully grasp the concepts being presented.
